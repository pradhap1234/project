            <p class="text-white ht2">PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's 
                Battlegrounds) is a battle royale game developed and published
                 by PUBG Studios, a subsidiary of Krafton. The game, which was 
                 inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, is based on
                  previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for
                   other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's
                    creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute
                     onto an island where they scavenge for weapons and e tightening space to force encounters.
                        The last surviving player (or team) wins the round.
                 It is the first game in the PUBG Universe series</p>

                 franchise published by Activision. Starting out
                  in 2003, it first focused on games set in World War
                   II. Over time, the series has seen games set in the 
                   midst of the Cold War, futuristic worlds, and outer space.
                    The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then also 
                    by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld 
                    games were made by other developers. The most recent title, Call of Duty: Vanguard, was released 
                on November 5, 2021. The next title, 
                Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, will
